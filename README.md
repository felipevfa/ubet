# uBet

uBet is an web application made for betting with friends in a 'russian roulette' fashion. The players make their bets and the system randomly selects a winner, awarding them all points that were bet in the round. The users can then use game points as they please.

The application is currently running at [uBet](https://ubetgame.herokuapp.com) at Heroku.
